RokuPlayer is a small app that lets you control your Roku SoundBridge device from your Android device.

It uses the Roku RCP protocol to comunicate with the SoundBridge device, allowing you to see all the media servers on your network and play any music from them.

I would like that as many people as possible take the code and improve it, so that we have a better application we can all enjoy using.
